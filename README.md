# My DSA Journey – From Basics to Advanced

This repository contains my complete journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms. I started from the very basics like understanding what coding is and gradually moved towards advanced concepts like Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and Tries.

This is not just a collection of solutions, but a structured path that helped me build strong problem-solving skills for interviews and real-world software development.

- What is coding
- Flowcharts and logic building
- Time and space complexity

### 2. Programming Fundamentals (C++)
- Variables and data types
- Operators, conditionals, and loops
- Arrays (1D, 2D)
- Functions and control flow

### 3. Searching and Sorting
- Linear search, binary search
- Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort
- Time complexity analysis

### 4. Core Concepts
- Strings and basic string operations
- Basic maths needed for coding
- Pointers and memory understanding

### 5. STL (Standard Template Library)
- Vectors, sets, maps, stacks, queues
- STL algorithms and iterators

### 6. Recursion and Backtracking
- Recursive thinking
- Backtracking problems like Sudoku, N-Queens, Rat in a Maze

### Graphs
- BFS and DFS
- Cycle detection
- Topological sorting
- Minimum spanning tree algorithms

### Greedy Algorithms
- Activity selection
- Huffman coding and other greedy patterns

### Dynamic Programming
- Memoization and tabulation
- 0/1 Knapsack, longest increasing subsequence, longest common subsequence

### Hashing and Tries

## Language Used

All implementations are done in C++ using STL where applicable.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository is for my own learning and revision. It contains structured folders for each topic with problems and notes. I’ll continue updating this as I practice more advanced problems and patterns.

Anyone preparing for interviews or trying to build a strong foundation in DSA can refer to this as a reference or revision guide.
