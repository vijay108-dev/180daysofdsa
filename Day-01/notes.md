## 1.Stone Method – Counting before Numbers
->In ancient times when numbers did not exist people used **stones** to keep count.

**Example:**  
Imagine a man going to the forest (let's say Ramu).  
He had 3 cows and 2 goats. Each time:
- For every cow he took, he placed a **stone in his left pocket**.
- For every goat, he placed a **stone in his right pocket**.
- On returning, he would count the stones to verify if all the animals came back.

## This was an early form of data management:
- **Stone** = One unit of data (like a variable)
- **Pocket** = A category (like an index in an array or a key in a hashmap)

## Egyptian Number System – Base 60

Ancient Egyptians used a **base-60 (sexagesimal)** number system.

- 1 hour = 60 minutes  
- 1 minute = 60 seconds  
- Fractions like 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 could be easily divided in base 60.

## Why base 60?
- 60 is divisible by many numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on)
- It was highly efficient for timekeeping trade and astronomy.



## 2.Decimal number System (Base 10)? 

### Q1: What is the Decimal (Base 10) Number System?

The **decimal system** uses **10 unique digits (0–9)** to represent all numbers.  
Each digit is position is based on powers of 10.


### Q2: Why do we use Base 10 in daily life?

->The main reason is **human biology** — we have **10 fingers**.  
Ancient people used fingers to count which made **base 10 a natural choice**.

---

### Q7: Why is Base 10 still preferred by humans?

 Because it is:
- Easy to understand  
- Matches human habits (finger counting)  
- Widely adopted in trade education and daily life

## Transistors?

---
### Q1: What is a Transistor?

A **transistor** is a small **electronic switch** that can **control the flow of electricity**.  
It is the building block of modern computers.

>  It is like a gate: ON (1) → electricity flows OFF (0) → it stops.  
> Computers use millions (even billions) of such gates to process binary data.

### Q2:Why transistors changed everything?

|  **Advantage**       |             **Impact**                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|  1.Smaller size      | Computers became compact                              |
|  2.Less power        | Devices used less electricity                         |
|  3.Less heat         | Overheating issues reduced (vs vacuum tubes)          |
|  4.Faster switching   | Data processed faster                                |
|  5.Cheaper           | Mass production became possible                       |
|  6.Portable devices  | Laptops, phones, wearables became real                |


### Q3: What was used before transistors?

Before transistors **vacuum tubes** were used for switching.

|  Vacuum Tubes          |      Transistors            |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Big and bulky          | Tiny can fit on a chip      |
| Consumed more power    | Energy efficient            |
| Produced lots of heat  | Less heat                   |
| Less reliable          | More durable & long-lasting |






## Number Systems – Binary, Decimal, Octal and Hexadecimal

### Q1: What are Number Systems? 

->Number systems are ways to **represent numbers using different bases**.

### Common Number Systems:

|  **System**        |  **Base**   |  **Digits Used**            |    **Used In**                     |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Binary             | 2           | 0, 1                        | Computers (low-level)              |
| Decimal            | 10          | 0–9                         | Daily life, maths                  |
| Octal              | 8           | 0–7                         | Old computer systems               |

###  Q1: What is Moore’s Law?

**Moore’s Law** states that:

> *The number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every 2 years while the cost remains the same.*  

---


## Machine vs Assembly vs High-Level Languages 

---
###  Q1: What is Machine Language? 

- It is the **lowest-level language**  
- Written in **binary (0s and 1s)**  
- Directly executed by the CPU  
- **Very fast** but **very hard to understand**

>  Example: `10111001 00001101`  
>  You can't read it — but CPU can!

---

### Q2: What is Assembly Language?

- Slightly **above machine code**  
- Uses **mnemonics** (short words) like `MOV`, `ADD`, `SUB`  
- Needs an **assembler** to convert to machine code  
- Still hardware-specific

> Example:  
> `MOV AX, 05` → Move 5 into AX register)

---

### Q3: What is a High-Level Language?
---

- Closer to **human thinking**  
- Uses **English-like syntax**  
- Needs a **compiler or interpreter**  
- Not hardware-specific — works on many systems

> Example:  
> (Python, C++, Java, etc.)

---

### Q4: Comparison Table

|  **Language Type**     |  **Who understands it?**   |   **Readable by humans?** | ⚡ **Speed**  |  **Needs Translator?**       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
|  Machine Language      | CPU (Directly)              |  No                         |  Very Fast  |  No (already machine code)  |
|  Assembly Language     | CPU (After assembling)      | Difficult                 |  Fast       |  Assembler needed           |
|  High-Level Language   | Humans (Then compiled)      | Yes                        |  Slower    |  Compiler/Interpreter       |

---

### InShort:

>  Machine Language → Fastest but unreadable  
> Assembly Language → Slightly readable still complex.  
> High-Level Language → Easy to use portable human-friendly.
